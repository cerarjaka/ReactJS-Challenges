# ReactJS-Challenges

All the challenges are in different directories.
The challenges include one possible solution to the problem/challenge.

The challenge is in the codependend directory in a Markdown-File.

# How to start

To start the challenge you need to create a NextJS Application.<br>
It is recommended to create a new directory in the challenge directory and have your **NextJS** application in it.<br>
<br>
In the NextJS folder execute the following command `npx create-next-app .`<br>
**It is important to not forget the dot(.) in the command.**<br>
<br>
After the command is completed the directory structure of the challenge could look like this (depends on where you created your project directory):<br>
<br>
![](docs/img/2022-01-25-21-48-58.jpg)<br>
The <i>DisplayData.jsx</i> does not affect the project at all.
If you want to use the predefined file just copy and paste it into the components directory which you have to create first.<br>
<br>
If you open the file pages/index.js and the first letter in the file is red underlined, then you should replace the <i>.babelrc</i> and <i>.eslintrc.json</i> in the challenge directory with the files from the **docs directory**.
