# Challenge 02 - Loop over Data

## What to expect in this challenge
In this challenge you will use data from <i>users.js</i> to loop over it and display
all the users in a list. <br>
<br>
## How to do the challenge
Use the component file <i>LoopOverData.jsx</i> for this challenge.<br>
<i>To import the users use the following command.</i><br>
<code>import users from users.js</code><br>
<br>
Implement a button and a list element. Loop over the users.js object. The button should toggle the list's visibility. It is recommended to use useState and useEffect for this challenge but it is not necessary for solving the problem.
